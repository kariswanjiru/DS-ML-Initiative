TASK 1:MACHINE LEARNING 
EXERCISE
How would you define Machine Learning?
Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
What is a labeled training set?
What are the two most common supervised tasks?
Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow
a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers
into multiple groups?
Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised
learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?
What is an online learning system?
What is out-of-core learning?
What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to
make predictions?
What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning
algorithmâ€™s hyperparameter?
What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the
most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make
predictions?
Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?
If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes
poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three
possible solutions?
What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?
What is the purpose of a validation set?
What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you
use it?
What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test
set?
